# Machine Learning by Andrew Ng
Exercises from the highly recommended, and free, online course offered at :: https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning
This is easily one of the most - if not **the most** - popular introductory online machine learning class. For an introduction course it covers a fair bit of ground covering various algorithms in machine learning such as Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, Unsupervised Learning, Anomaly Detection, Recommender Systems, etc. But, what I (and I'm sure many others) , love about this course is that it explains the math behind the various algorithms in addition to getting you hands on with the coding.

The course uses [GNU Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) as the programming language, since we're largely dealing with numerical computations. While many might consider it as a downer, I was quite happy to get introduced to [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) thru it. 
I then rewrote the whole set of exercises in Python 3, which further helped cement my understanding of the course material.
